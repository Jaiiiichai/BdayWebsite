                <p>Happy birthday to my cute and adorable princess, Hi love I know this is so cringe and making a website makes it more cringe but 
I really want you to know that you are so special to me and this website is not enough to show how much I appreciate you, this is 
and unfinished website because I did not have much time and I hope you liked it. I wanted to celebrate your bday togetherr and go out 
but we cant do it but I want to go out with you as soon as possible and I really miss you so much.This is the start of the last year 
of you teenage years and lets make it memorable by going on many adventures but it wont stop cause we will be going on adventure forever,
so stick with me and i will make it a reality. You are the girl I prayed for and I promise to treat you right and I will not hurt you.
Thank you for your assurance, you always make me happy and you me feel happiness that I have never felt before. I am so scared of losing
you thats why I get sad everytime I mess up or made you sad. You always told me that you are unlovable but you are not. I will love you
in every ways and I will not leave even in tough times. I will always be your wingman,your baby, your princess, your errand boy, your brother,
lover,bestfriend and everything else. Always remember to be happy and dont change your mindset to always enjoy life and forget about
negative things. Everything happens for a reason so keep on pushing forward and always show your beautiful smile. Enjoy your day and I wish you will
have a very happy life. Happy birthday love</p>
